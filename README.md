# Overview

This is a small REST API that allows a user to create and maintain a contact list.

I wrote this to gain more experience writing a server using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and Postman to develop this project.

I wrote this using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. I used the file system that's built in Node to read and write to a JSON file that holds all the contact info. I also used an npm package called Nodemon to quickly restart my server after making file changes to speed up development.

# Future Work

- Convert the Address class to an interface
- Add validation to the contact fields
- Swap out the file system to use a database instead
